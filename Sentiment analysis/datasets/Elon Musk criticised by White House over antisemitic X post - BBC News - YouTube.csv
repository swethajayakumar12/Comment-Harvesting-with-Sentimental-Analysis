"To those skeptical of Elon Musk, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of undermining his ventures.

1. SpaceX's Starship Failure:
If SpaceX's Starship project were to fail, the repercussions extend beyond Musk and SpaceX. In the absence of a viable American alternative, China could seize the opportunity to dominate space exploration. Given the financial constraints faced by NASA, a setback for SpaceX could lead to a significant gap in space capabilities, ultimately compromising America's position in the global space race.

2. Tesla's Stability and Elon Musk's Role:
Removing Elon Musk from Tesla's board might seem like a victory for some investors, but it comes with substantial risks. Musk's significant stake in the company means that his departure could trigger the sale of his shares, potentially destabilizing Tesla's financial standing. This, in turn, could result in the company going bankrupt, causing severe economic ramifications not just for Tesla but for the broader electric vehicle industry.

3. National Security and Innovation:
Despite Elon Musk's imperfections, his role in driving innovation is undeniable. Crushing him entirely may have broader implications for U.S. national security. Musk's ventures are at the forefront of technological advancements, and stifling his contributions could set back American competitiveness in key industries by a decade or more. Recognizing and fostering innovation, even within the context of individual flaws, is crucial for maintaining the nation's technological edge and safeguarding national security.

In summary, it's essential to be mindful of the broader consequences that actions against Elon Musk could have on space exploration, the electric vehicle industry, and U.S. innovation and national security. Rather than solely focusing on individual grievances, a more balanced perspective is necessary to ensure the continued progress and strength of American technology and industry.",,,,

"Your argument is so incoherent. Listen to how you put it as though loosing friends is a sign that Musk has not told the truth disregarding of what I think about his tweets. Is this an axiome, somehow? Could this be  Xtended to let' s say"" the pursuit of truth is the cause of losing freiends""? You insist on that in an annoying way as though by repeating on how he is left without any friends you may happen to believe it and make other to believe it too. Or is it that you  are served the justice for ""mistakenly taking for truth his saying""?.Or is it just your wish? Assuming it is true that he is losing friends because of this. Is his thinking invalidated  and irrelevant. It is his thinking and he is entitled to expressing it as he thinks so. Is not that he committed a sacrilege at all. He did not offend God. Although saying this about the people he refferred to, it seems to be even worse, had he offended God Himself. And I am sure God would be less offended. Proof of it He even begged for the forgiveness of whom just cruciffied Him.",,,,

"The market trend can turn around very quickly. In fact, the indexes often switch from a bear market to a bull market when the news is at its worst and the mood of investors is at its lowest point.  I read an article of people that grossed profits up to $150k during this crash, what are the best stocks to buy now or put on a watchlist?",
"Liz Young might be right this time. My question remains that with all of the current events, what is the best approach to profit from the present market? I'm still debating diversifying my $436k stock portfolio to obtain some profits while minimizing risk.",

"Markets look like 2015-16. Probably going back to all time highs, but will probably go sideways until fed signals rate cut, Recently sold 25% of my $400k portfolio comprising of plummeting stocks that were recommended by certain financial YouTubers, quite devastating!",
"She is partly right as markets rallied to quick and some pullback will happen in next 2 weeks. sentiments are bullish till year end and could see all time highs, I have lost almost $120K in my stock portfolio. it's been a rough ride.",
"Investors sent stocks soaring on Tuesday, cheering the October Consumer Price Index report that showed inflation slowed more than expected last month.What is the greatest strategy to take advantage of the current bull market while I'm still deciding whether to sell my $300k worth of stocks?",
Liz: Sell all Apple and Microsoft.   Put all our portfolio into VHS players.   Me: Yes Ma'am. Done.,
The FED doesn’t cut unless the economy goes south. These are normal interest rates. Not restrictive interest rates. You have to get over 6% to start becoming restrictive.,
"Every crash/collapse brings with it an equivalent market chance if you are early informed and equipped, I've seen folks amass up to $1m amid crisis, and even pull it off easily in a favorable economy. Unequivocally, the bubble/collapse is getting somebody somewhere rich",
She is right!,
"Wait until about May of next year when they start to cut interest rates, you will need to be in the market before that, which the market is predicting as you see the stock rebound vigorously the last few weeks.  You also get the Christmas Rally.  Stay in the market and enjoy your holidays.",
"Liz Young has been wrong for a year now.. it's amazing to watch her confidence about the economy definitely rolling over for a whole year while stocks rallied the entire time!  Apparently, Wall Street pays you for the confidence and not for making money.  The economy might indeed roll over next year (2024), but she also missed a massive rally from Oct 2022!  Anyone can predict a crash in the future, as long as you keep pushing that date further and further as you are proven wrong... I wish I could be this confident when I am wrong.",
I'm only inclined to agree w/ her bc I know the Fed will wait too late to cut,
stocks are definitely clear for take-off to SPY 499 by march and small caps will outperform,
"The Supreme Court will hear the case after the 9th appeals upheld allowing it, sending the matter to the SCOTUS. Oral arguments scheduled this Dec with a decision nlt than next summer or sooner.",
She is partly right as markets rallied to quick and some pullback will happen in next 2 weeks. However sentiments are bullish till year end and could see all time highs,

"With world markets tumbling, inflation soaring, the Fed imposing large interest-rate hikes, the treasury yields rising rapidly, markets manipulations, and many other factors makes me wonder if people still make profits from all these investing BS.",

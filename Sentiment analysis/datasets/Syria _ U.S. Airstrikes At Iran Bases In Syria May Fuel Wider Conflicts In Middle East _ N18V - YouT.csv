It is a sad truth that countries such as Syria and Iran see any attempt at negotiation as a sign of weakness. The only thing that they respect is strength. The US would do well to remember this and act accordingly.
I like when they say “if they attack our people than we will defend our people etc etc etc.” yet we have been attacked 19 times.
Funny how quickly they tried to make us forget about the Russia-Ukraine war due to their failures.  
Iran doesn’t want direct conflict that’s why it’s uses these other Groups to Fight
"Dang,  i feel bad for those people who are still recovering from decades of rockets destroying their homes."
A Prelude of a Bigger Conflict is Inevitable.
When politicians mouth is moving..lies are flowing
"The US is getting sucked deeper into this conflict. Someone said, the military wants to stay sharp and test their skills."
Why would you even start a war when the enemy has planes that refuel in the sky  the mismatch is unreal
We shouldn’t be getting attacked. We shouldn’t be there at all for our forces to be attacked.
"I’m just glad that we have strong, competent and wise leadership during these trying times"
"To think what could be done with the time, energy, money that is used for wars to be used for something constructive."
Iran complaining about the US being in a place they shouldn't while simultaneously have been interfering with Syria's conflict for years 
"Just heard a state department spokesperson use the words ""rules of war"" to answer a question.  The realty of it is, there are no rules in a war.  You are fighting to defeat/kill your enemy by any means possible.  I have to laugh because the USA always tries to fight ""cleanly"" when its opponent is doing what ever it can to win.  As an American, I do not want our country sending any American troops to fight in a war that the USA is not directly involved in.  May I add that if a weapon is fired from another country and an American military person is hurt/killed,  then the USA needs to handle business ASAP, in as strong of a manner as possible."
"With all these war conflicts, the United States wants to be testing its new war toys."
19 times how many times we got to be attacked before we “ Swiftly” act?
"Iran playing the ""hold me back, hold me back"" routine is a great summary. They don't want to have US attention"
Weird they keep putting our troops right next to the guys they think might shoot at them
These people think they can attack anyone and not have consequences.
It is always the old man calling for war because he knows he won't be called on to fight and die.
"Thank you for saying that 
Us need to be careful about it’s own army’s rather than Israel !!!"
Too bad we don't have compitent leadership going into this
God bless us and have mercy on us thank you.
why are we getting into this fight? what's out there for America to gain by getting into this fight? I get it its bad for the fact that people is getting killed. but I also see that its never that simple for us to get into a fight and its almost a gain for the few and a lot of death and injured for the fighters we send in. so I guest im asking what are getting for us fighting this war. the meaning the few American that well make money from this. we have enough problems at home I just think. and don't need any more at the moment.
Apparently the message wasn't received! US base got hit again last night!
The way he’s talking about this like it’s some school yard fight is crazy.
The only message Joe sends is 10% for the big  guy
This government is nothing but a liability to this country
This will pump up the US economy and the US knows it needs the economic stimulus into the country.
Funny how this is a lot like the beginning of the Iraq war.
Notice how the Iranian military is totally unable to stop air strikes 
U SCA has out of this World craft in the air. I’ve seen the small black triangles I haven’t seen a big one you can see the small ones with night vision a PVS – 14 and turn the gain  up just a little bit.
"I hope someone is doing something to make sure the kids from both sides are loved and are given effective and consistent therapy…If not, we’ll be in the same place 5-15 years from now. And could we really blame them?"
"The picture of the 2 fighter jets are not USA aircraft, they are 2 F-15’s from the IDF, wing color indicates so."
"The US secretary of state stated he has Duel citizenship with the Tel-aviv regime...
How many politicians holding seats of power have Duel citizenship to the tel-aviv regime.  And who's loyalty are they committed."
The fact that they got a thumbnail like that it's all you need to know about this war
Weapons = business = death 
Brandon has really done it to us.
Dodge ball analogy wasnt the best choice. LMFAO 
Heres a thought-if U.S. personnel wasn't there in the first place we wouldn't be seeing or hearing of any attacks now would we.
Who ever comes in the Oval Office stands always in the favour of Israel .
You really can’t believe anything they say.Maybe they did maybe they didn’t.Lie lie lie
This is going to get worse. They already have boots on ground by the time you hear it in the news. Happened to me in 2003.
Well at least we have a commander in chief who has all his mental faculty. I think he said it like this “I’m just like a fly”…yeah I know it doesn’t make sense
"God bless all nations and I want all people to know ""GOD IS IN CONTROL"" nobody can stop what HE has planned our arms are to short to box with GOD if we all would repent of our sins admit that we are sinners and ask GOD to guide our steps and words and treat all how we want treated we would have no reason for war or any of this period......"
They told Joe what to do!  He is a shell!
Fueling more problems
No money  for home problems but money  for war  and problems we always have it
"Brandon, leading our country by trying to read what someone else wrote on the teleprompter without f*cking up. Inspirational."
We must do more to promote love and peace on earth as in the song sung by Fabiola Carmelita called PEOPLE LIKE YOU.  I love that song and the clip.
"We hit empty warehouses.   What a joke, the enemy is now laughing about our intel."
"And yet good old Joey basically enabled all this when he was VP. $6 billion for Iran Joey, $6 billion  ."
So many distractions 
"Um...did that guy say genocide on Hamas or did he say the whole state of Gaza. I'm confused. Last I heard Isreal was going after Hamas. And told the civilians of Gaza to get out of the war way. So, how is that genocide?"
why was the Iranian leader not taken into custody for his war crimes of holding innocent prisoners while he was within our grasp in New York. We have such weak and corrupt leadership
"When I hear that Americans are committing genocide,it really shows the intelligence of Iran,or lack there of..."
Words more than action
I love these guys trying to figure out or read into whatever someone is doing.  President Biden by saying this is .................. Blah blah blah blah
Democracy for world peace... 
Only after they target us over 20 times what a joke
Biden won’t act as he forgets as soon as it happens 
None of this insanity would be happening under a Trump presidency. This is what happens with weakness.
When US send the old aircraft and ships to aid.. -.-
"Analyse this, that or the other, we know that the Iranian Regime does not fear the US and that its repost is always inevitable while its timing entirely unpredictable. US celebrated when they killed Soleimani and patted itself on the back, and Israeli's were smug about assassinating Iranian nuclear physicists.  We can all see these actions are ultimately paid for by the death and maiming of completely innocent civilians usually first, followed by servicemen and women under the chain of command.  BUT NEVER COMMAND ITSELF.  Support for WAR CRIME has consequences, one of which is to pale the heinous crimes of 7/10/23 into insignificance and the other, an inevitable tectonic repost."
I  know its silly.. .but I was expecting to see the F14... not a F16...
The US cant even protect our vets
America always acts under United Nations International Law for self-defense according to US Regulations to protect justice of the world.
This is exactly what Putin wants….
Also thank you fo your straight answer.
The US;The offender who doesn't want to be offended is certainly a bully
Originally the prez tried to send those bi wing planes.  But he was told that none run and then the b-52s and then was told thats a band and the walked off after saying thanks ohio.
"Well the war has already escalated into Israel-Iran war. And will likely also include Iran-US war involving Lebanon, Syria and Iraq."
THE LORD WILL CEASE ALL WARS  GOD BLESS US ALL HOORAH
يا يسوع المسيح، بارك الأبرياء 🇵🇸️ أرسل لك الكثير من الحب والدعم من قلبي من بولندا.  نحن الناس العاديين، مع المسيح في قلوبنا، نصلي إلى الله من أجل السلام والبركة لأطفالكم ونسائكم 
STOP wars we don’t want to see anymore of this stuff STOP killing humanity we all should be friends and have peace instead of killings 
Never heard anyone call it I rock before
The only message this administration sends is weakness
United States has only one base in Syria but now a lot of them in Syria what's going on
"You can say that you don't want conflict with Iran, but Iran wants conflict with the US, and saying that you will protect US interests, is letting Iran know what it will take for them to successfully provoke a US response, so whether you want to or not, Iran will ensure that you will engage in conflict with Iran."
"That’s it joe, don’t let them push yo around"
What ever happened to the budget failure we had not even a month ago?
They always saying attack us personel.. lol
"Lol "" going for the big guy"" that would mean attacking IRAN!! not the other countries."
"These clashes are increasingly caring less about hiding backers. This will eventually become a direct conflict more than likely.

Also once again, religion as a cause of war ️"
True leadership is defined by steadfastness to defend and act to what is right.Empty promises escalates the ongoing conflicts and innocent civilians die every single day.Its not over until its over
I got a friend out there rn hope he ok rn he in the army too
Well Done Mr president 🇺🇸 by protecting our soldiers in Syria and Iran is nothing but a burking  he doesn't want to face what America has for him.
This is so world they attacked us no war officially we attacked them no war officially what is going on
"If America has sent a big message to Iran, then it should expect a big response from Iran."
Jesus guide and protect our military men and women in Jesus name I pray Amen 
Trump avoided being draft for war. He would do the same thing today for his family members and friends.
This has been postponed for a very long time and i think the time is now.
"20 Now while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God, 21 yes, while I was speaking in prayer, the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, [c]being caused to fly swiftly, reached me about the time of the evening offering. 22 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, “O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill to understand. 23 At the beginning of your supplications the [d]command went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision"
USA just playing by the rules that includes testing their new weapons.
The title photo of the F-15 dropping bombs is a few years old
President Biden is going to save us right after his nap.
IRans bark is bigger than it's bite
We are always looking for trouble.
"I am MAGA, plan to vote for President Trump, but I have to say I greatly admire President Biden for his adament , down right brave response to Irans threats!"
Well Iran has been attacking US outposts with impunity for years so…
America is putting its into too many countries but it couldn't solve it's problem at home.
"Iran has the right to defend itself and will hit back hard at America because the US is just looking for Iran to see how far they can go, but they can soon expect retaliation from Iran when they do not expect it
It seems"
"Luke 13:6-9  Barren Fig Tree
6 He also spoke this parable: “A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it and found none. 7 Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard, ‘Look, for three years I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none. Cut it down; why does it [b]use up the ground?’ 8 But he answered and said to him, ‘Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. 9 [c]And if it bears fruit, well. But if not, after that you can cut it down.’ ”"
Do We Have Any Ships Left To Defend Our Coast Now?
Everything has been so much better since Biden became president
"You want them to cease fire while under attack, these guys are not even on this planet.. you gotta love the ones making threats and starting  are sitting nice and peaceful at home."
It only gonna get Worse 
Way to go Jill Biden...keep up the good work!
"🇨🇳🇺🇲 “The United States is a war junkie. The country has existed for 240 years, and only 16 of them have not been at war. They have built 800 military bases around the world. Wherever the American military goes, people suffer everywhere,” - speaker of the Chinese Ministry of Defense"
The US would never try this on Russia.
End all wars.
People used to sympathise with the Israelis for what they alleged to have suffered under Hitler. Now many thought Hitler knew better than most of us. 5 out of 10 who previously pitied the Israelis now thought they were wrong.
Biden is going to have to shut his mouth and act ! Show them he means what he says and by doing so he will earn their respect
Why were there US troops in that region to begin with
"0:55 the US does not seek conflict with Iran, nor with Russia, nor with China, and even less with Palestinians. 
Blinken is truly funny.
like when he pretends that geting in the Israel conflict, moves closer to US security ... who believes that ? it is a joke ... he is funny. 
as a jew, protecting his brothers ... i would question to what degree his heart is American or Israeli."
I doubt we used f-16's . Maybe a carrier battle group with f-35s around? 
Humanitarian Aid being brought in. Medical equipment. Medication for gonorrhea and STD .
We need Trump back. There’s no way the lesser country like Iran would threaten the US if we had Trump in office.
The US needs Trump back into office.  Biden or his cabinet can not do a thing.  Biden needs to go quickly.
glad I live in the us!
The Iranians have a right to protect themselves
"Oh well, we all Néw this is coming!"
Russia is partly to this game
US military needs to bring back the draft. We are going to need it. Oh but IMPEACH BIDEN first!!!
"Dear God - the great I am . Protect the Children I pray. 

Keep them safe in your  hands."
I don't think IRAN would be that easy hopefully don't escalate worst  then what it is
The fact that Joe biden can still talk is a miracle
It's all about the oil
How about our border. We need ships and planes at our border and build the wall.
"Did Congress confirm these strikes.
 Oh how Biden smiles as he is so excited abot his world wide Armigedon.
  Lord have Mercy.
  Pray the Rosary every day and have Faith and Hope in Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior "
"After the fulfilment of Ezekiel 37 prophecy in 1948, we're now seeing Ezekiel 38 being fulfilled too."
“I-rock?” So self-congratulatory.
President Biden is doing  a good job we  don't need Trump anymore
🇺🇸
What would happen if America would only be present in the USA?
a country asking to have nuclear 
How you attack a country and get mad when they strike back  makes zero sense
What is USA doing in Iran's region?
Got money for wars but can’t feed the poor-2pac
Iran making threats 
The real message is. Sell your oil only accepting the USD Petrodollar for payment.
Well if the US has anything to do with it it will spread
We are not their battlefield pawns?
Iran already make mistake
"""we do not want this war, but are offended that our forces are getting attacked inside their countries"" "
Coalition forces 
OIC should take action.
Thank Sr. Yes we are Stant on anything.

"Let those culprits bring back all the civilians taken custody, then they will think about stopping the war."
Who told you to go out there in the first place 
Fairly certain that the zhot rockets at the US embassy. ????? No response
Rich man always make poor man fight us poor people would love each other no matter where you from
"I thought, “ make no mistakes” slogan was Netanyahu trademark"
3:45 Iran's military march music sounds so dark almost diabolic and all The soldiers look alike.
Make no mistake.  I Remember  that phrase from somewhere.
"If you people only knew, this WAR not what y'all think it is."
USA always show real face
Why are we there? Is the question I would ask
These are the little slaps before the “find out”

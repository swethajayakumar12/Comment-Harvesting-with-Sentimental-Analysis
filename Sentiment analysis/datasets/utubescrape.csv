"Did this work for you? 
Yes?  Give me a shoutout in the comments! 
No?  Leave a comment with your issue and we'll figure it out together."
"i never  really used Twitter, only a few times and always wondered why I couldn't see all the comments when I clicked on it. Then thought ""whatever"" and moved on. Thanks, that was actually simple, but I don't think I'm the only one who had to go to a YT-video to figure it out :)"
Straight to the point
Thanks for this! As an infrequent Twitter user I can't get over how far from intuitive that is. I always click on the comment icon thinking I'll see them but it never works. Now I know the secret. Lol
Thank you so much! This is very helpful to me.
"Have being on twitter for almost a year  but didn’t know how to read comment
I came to youtube to be taught  because I wanted to read comment on a certain post on twitter
Thank you very much "
 I wasn't expecting that ez thanks a lot
"Thank goodness, I thought it was just me. There is a whole lot more I gotta learn on Twitter. I'm sure I will be back to your ch. I just subscribed and thumb's upped!! TY"
Thank you! Super helpful!
"Thanks.....You helped a minor (me) seeing a useless thing that i coundt learn myself because im a  dumb minor with 0,1 braincells.....Good channel and video btw.

Edit 1: I just edited the comment to make you see this keyboard emoji that i use on replies on twitter: "":3""

Edit 2: i editted it again to make sure that you wasted some more seconds with a minor with less than 14 years....And its a good person, but its bad at organization and studying...Thats why Rafael (The minor who made this comment)  gets bad grades.....No more edits, just making sure that you remember that i use the keyboard emoji that is made with The Colon symble and the number Three :D"
Damn this whole time I thought they just wouldn’t let you read other people comments  thank you
"I cannot believe this has taken me over a decade to find out.  Where are all the comments?  Clicking on everything in SITE and have never been able to figure it out. It's a WONDER that ANYONE uses this SITE when the most basic function appears to be deliberately obfuscated.  I should remember to say, ""Thanks,"" to you, but I'm still miffed at the great ""X"" ... by the way, isn't there a user tutorial on ""X""?  Maybe if I triple click on X icon while holding CTRL ALT  X, but only on Wednesdays in November?"
The very fact that this video exists proves that twitter sucks and I never use it.
"Thank you, very helpful video ️️"
Thank you!  I never would have thought to click on the date!
So helpful thanks
Thank you so much! Twitter is super confusing for me.
"thank you that was great, liked :-)"
thank you. took me a month to figure it out 
"Very nice, thank you"
So glad it's not just me ;0)  Thank you
Thank u really helped ️
Thank you so much
They can't just show you the comments section when you tap on the comments icon like every other normal app with a comments section
Thanks!!! What does it take to get a blue check mark if you are just a normal person? I don't have an iPhone either
Merciiiiiiii pour tous
"Thought maybe this video was going to address when there is a problem; when it doesn't work like its supposed to   (ex: I can comment, and see my comment, but none of the other 15 comments)"
Thanks a bunch
Thank you for making me smarter.
Thank you so much it helped
Thank you
thank you. its a shame i had to come on youtube to find out how to work twitter. they need to fix that.
Thanks and love you mam this is creative
"The date! You need to click on the date! That makes no sense. Thank you for your help, finally I can use twitter on pc now."
This didn’t answer my question and I’ll go read about it instead but just in case someone else might be looking for help. I try to post my own comment and keep receiving an error sign to Retry over and over and I have dozens of comments there on whatever page they take me on to show me that.
Thanks u so helpful
Thanks 
" ""you can do it put your back into it"" "
Been two good years but still not know how to view twitter comments ..it I searched 
"Thanks,Face book are constantly jailing me for wrong opinions so I will give Twitter a go haha."
"thanks, twitter is so hard to use at first"
"I always get replies to my comments, but can't find my comment they were replying to. There must be some way."
Everything is supposed to be so easy right? And us old people just don't have a clue. Who would ever in a million years figure out to see comments on a post you have to click the time it was posted? Why? Why isn't there some kind of comments icon?
"Hi, I'm using chromebook and don't have the app but when I click on the post I still can't see the comments. Can anyone help please."
"Yeah, but I can't see the comments to my own tweets."
"When I click a gif to see the comments under it it does not pop up, am I doing something wrong?"
thanks
"is there a way to see the comments ON comments, like if someone replies to someones comment on the tweet"
"Can someone help me! Someone replied on my tweet, and I can view the comment however I am confused how to read my tweet which he commented coz I forgot what I tweeted that made him replied on it."
I posted a tweet on twitter and got a comment on it although when I click on it it doesn’t say I have a comment on that tweet but there is a 1 next to the comment icon
Why I am able to see only comments of verified persons in Twitter posts.. why not other person comments?
"In my list of owners responses to my comments in X, how do I see what the post was and my comment was?"
Thanks hun
I know how to read an entire thread of comments. But I want to know why I can't see the comments on my tweets. I can on some. Other tweets I put out show a comment. I go there and NOTHING shows. What's up with that? Right now analytics and the thread show I have a comment. Nothing there when I go to look.
"Ty, becuz i wondering why i couldnt go to them"
"When someone replies to a comment I’ve made, how do I see which comment of mine they’re replying to?"
"Thank You, this method is soo dumb twitter needs to update it to be like Facebook"
Actually disgusting that I can put together a computer piece by piece but had to watch this video to figure out how to read comments on dumbass Twitter
Thanks
Yea still won't show the comments in the tweets on Twitter
"not working, cant see comments on app"
Why is twitter so user unfriendly?
Hello I have problem whyI can not see commments in my twitter account I mean in my tweets Isee just number that someone comment but not show why ?
thx. twitter is really unlogical with that ...

I feel embarrassed now
"Randomly works. It's twitter is a mess.
Hope Elon doesn't have to pay shit."
Not simple if you have to see a video to find it.
thanks! shoutout
tks
this absolutely does not work on a PC as of 2023
Doesn't work
Click on the date. How unintuitive. Thanx for the info
Thenkque
